(** {1 Identifier encoding}

    This section implements encoding of arbitrary strings into the output
    character set (i.e., [[0-9A-Za-z_]], see {!is_out_char} for more details).

    The encoded string is composed of:
    - an optional [u], which is a flag indicating how the payload is encoded
      ([u] stands for {i universal} or {i Unicode}, as it allows any string of
      bytes to be encoded),
    - a decimal integer, which is the length of the following component,
    - the payload.

    If the original string contains only output characters and does not start
    with a digit, the payload is the original string as is and the optional [u]
    is absent.

    Otherwise, the encoded string will start by [u]. The payload is computed by
    first decomposing the original string into the subsequence of its output
    characters and its non-output characters, and then by concatenating:
    {ul
    {- for each chunk of consecutive non-output characters:
      - encode its relative insertion position as a base-26 number (see
        {!base26}),
      - encode every character in that chunk by the hexadecimal code of each
        byte, using lowercase letters (i.e., [[0-9a-f]], see {!hex}),}
    {- the separator character [_],}
    {- the string of output characters.}}

    Note that the choices of using decimal integers for the length, base-26
    numbers for the insertion positions and lowercase hexadecimal for bytes
    means that no explicit separator is required, it's never ambiguous.

    {2 Some examples}

    - [Structured_mangling] is composed only of output characters and starts
      with a letter (not a digit) so its payload is the original string and its
      full encoding with a space to increase legibility is
      [19 Structured_mangling].
    - [>>=] contains only non-output characters, so it is decomposed into the
      empty string (of output characters) and the sequence of consecutive
      characters [>>=] (so, in hexadecimal [3e 3e 3d]) that should be inserted
      at position 0 (so, in base-26 [A]); its full encoding is [u 8 A 3e3e3d _],
      again with spaces to increase legibility.
    - [let*] is decomposed into [let], and [*] (so [2a]) to insert at position 3
      (so [D]) in [let]; its full encoding is [u 7 D 2a _ let].
    - [func'sub'] is decomposed into [funcsub], ['] (so [27]) to insert at
      position 4 (so [E]) and a second ['] to insert at relative position 3 (the
      length of [sub], so [D]); its full encoding is then
      [u 14 E 27 D 27 _ funcsub]. *)

(** [is_out_char c] is true iff [c] is in the output character set, i.e., the
    restricted set of characters that are allowed in our mangled symbols. That
    set is constrained by portability across operating systems and architectures
    and so is restricted to just ASCII alphanumeric and underscore characters.
*)
let is_out_char = function
  | '0' .. '9' | 'A' .. 'Z' | 'a' .. 'z' | '_' -> true
  | _ -> false

(** [base26 buf n] encodes the integer [n] as a base-26 number using [[A-Z]]
    into the buffer [buf], with [A] standing for 0, [B] for 1, ..., [Z] for 25,
    [BA] for 26, [BB] for 27, ... *)
let rec base26 buf n =
  (* Technically, we are not constrained to just 26 characters here. Uniqueness
     is still preserved if we include non-hex characters (i.e., [[g-z]]). *)
  let upper = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" in
  let r = n mod 26 and q = n / 26 in
  if q > 0 then base26 buf q;
  Buffer.add_char buf upper.[r]

(** [hex buf c] encodes the [char] [c] in hexadecimal (using lowercase letters)
    in the buffer [buf] *)
let hex buf c =
  let chars = "0123456789abcdef" in
  let c = Char.code c in
  let h = (c lsr 4) land 0xf and l = c land 0xf in
  Buffer.add_char buf chars.[h];
  Buffer.add_char buf chars.[l]

(* State for the encoding state machine: [Raw] = processing output characters,
   [Esc] = processing escaped (non-output) characters. *)
type encode_state =
  | Raw
  | Esc

(** [require_escaping str] is [true] iff (a) [str] contains a non-output
    character or (b) it starts with a digit. The latter is important to ensure
    that the encoded string can be non-ambiguously appended to the decimal
    integer representing its length in the mangling scheme.

    While not very common, identifiers that start with a digit can happen for
    anonymous modules and functions from a file whose name starts with a digit.
    For those, the compiler emits a warning but tolerates them. *)
